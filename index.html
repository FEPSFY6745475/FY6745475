  With technology advancing every day in more ways than we can imagine, travel has become a key focus point
  for development in our day of age. From electric cars to hydrogen powered planes, we can expect travel to change
  considerably in near future. One method of transportation however has overgone massive advancements in recent years;
  the train. Thanks to certain individuals who have come up with innovative concepts, the combination of magnets and 
  trains has recently come to light. This has sparked the creation of a new high-speed train – the maglev. This article 
  aims to provide you with a brief history of how the maglev came to be and the pros and cons so you can have a better 
  understanding of what transport may become available to you in the near future.

<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
  <pre>
    Maglev is short for magnetic levitation train. The train can reach speeds of up to 375mph (603 km/h), currently
    making it the fastest train in the world <a href="#japanRailPass">(japanRailPass, 2022)</a>. With speeds such as this, seamlessly connecting
    major cities across expansive countries becomes very accessible, reducing travel times significantly.

<h3 id="Main">Main</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
  <pre>
    The concept of maglevs first came to light during the early 1900s through an American professor named Robert
    Goddard and a French engineer named Emile Bachelet (Boslaugh, 2023). Following this, James Powell received
    the first patent for maglev during the 1960s (Energy, 2016). The idea came to him in a traffic jam where he
    dreamed up the idea of using superconducting magnetics to levitate a train car (Energy, 2016). 24 – 35 years
    later, the first commercial available maglev system was first developed in Great Britain. This was a shuttle
    between the Birmingham airport and a nearby rail station. Although only 600 meters long, it was a big leap 
    in technology at the time gave a glimpse of what the future of trains could possibly be. (Boslaugh, 2023)
    
    Despite complicated nature of superconducting magnets, the underlying concept is surprisingly straightforward.
    Fundamentally, it aligns with the basic principle that opposite poles attract and like poles repel. Coupled
    with phenomenon that magnets intensity increases when cooled, the maglev train became a real idea. Each train
    carriage is fitted with repelling poles on the bottom the keep the train floating just above the magnetic 
    tracks and alternating attracting poles on the sides to pull the train forward (Energy, 2016).
    
    With many countries investing in maglev, it is apparent that there are many benefits to this new train compared
    to previous high-speed trains. One of these is the fact that due to the train having no physical contact to
    the track, there is very little friction therefore making it very efficient and fast at accelerating (Anon., 2023).
    Furthermore, once the track has been built, very little maintenance will be required (Anon., 2023). Maglev can also
    handle a very high volume of passengers per hour and do so without air pollution (Anon., 2023). This is a big 
    factor, especially considering how recently everything is starting to go green. At this time, plans are underway
    for a hyperloop train line from Los Angeles to San Francisco that could reach speeds of up to 700 mph, almost 
    double the speed of the current fastest maglev in Japan (375mph) <a href="#japanRailPass">(japanRailPass, 2022)</a>. Not all maglev trains are
    fast, however, with the Aichi Rapid Transit Tobu Kyuryo Line in Japan having a 62mph top speed (WIKIPEDIA, 2023).
    Since there are variations of maglev trains, we could start to see this in our local communities at some point.
    
    However, despite over a century of research and development, there are only six of these trains in operation today
    – three in China, two in South Korea and one in Japan (WIKIPEDIA, 2023).  Whilst there a many small reasons for this,
    one stands above all – price. The tracks for maglev are made of precious materials and have magnetic coils embedded 
    used by the electromagnets (Anon., 2023) This makes them considerably more expensive than normal high-speed rail. 
    For reference, Japan has high speed bullet trains which on average cost $104 million per km to build. The maglev 
    currently being built is estimated to be $178 million per km (Bhushan, 2015). This is a whopping 72% increase PER
    KM for the maglev. With thousands of kilometres of track needing to be built, this is massively more expansive than
    usual bullet trains. Additionally, current railway infrastructure cannot be used by maglev so it will either be 
    replaced by the maglev system or an entirely new set up will be required <h3 id="">Figure1</h3>(Bhushan, 2015).

<h3 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p class="ex1">
<pre>
  In conclusion, maglev represents a remarkable leap in transportation. As explored in this article, these trains 
  provide unparalleled speed, efficiency and sustainability. Whilst maglev has provided great strides forwards, 
  cost is still an underlying issue. However, with continued research, investment and collaboration bringing the
  cost could very well be within the realms of possibility.  Looking into the future, it is clear maglev holds the
  promise to revolutionizing the way we commute and travel between main cities. I see this not just as a technological
  marvel but a potential key to more efficient and sustainable transportation for the future.
